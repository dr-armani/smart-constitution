## I. The Transitional Government (hereafter "TG") is formed as follows:

<ol type="1"> 
<li>TG shall consist of 50 Members (hereinafter “Members”).</li>
<li>Initially, three trusted neutral registrars are appointed to select a representative random sample of the population to vote.</li>
<li>Within 4 weeks of this appointment, the neutral registrars shall randomly select 1,200 citizens to vote anonymously and elect Members.</li>
<li>The legal birth dates of the 1,200 randomly selected voters should fall between January 1957 and December 2006 (inclusive), spanning 50 years (600 months) in total.</li>
 <ul>   
    <li>There should be exactly two voters born in each month: one biologically male (at birth) and one biologically female (at birth).</li>
    <li>This ensures a uniform distribution of age and gender, with exactly 50% (600 voters) biologically male and 50% (600 voters) biologically female.</li>
    <li>This maximizes diversity while limiting the choices for the neutral registrars.</li>
 </ul>
<li>During this 4‑week period, any person may register as a candidate for Membership, except the three neutral registrars and their relatives cannot become candidates or Members.</li>
<li>If, by day 28, at least 100 candidates and 1,200 voters are registered, the campaign period shall commence and last for 14 days.</li>
<li>If these minimum thresholds for candidates or voters are not met, the registration period shall be extended until both thresholds are met.</li>
   <ul><li>Once met, the campaign period shall commence and last for 14 days.</li></ul> 
<li>On the first day after the 14‑day campaign period, voters can vote to elect 50 Members in an open, inclusive and free election.</li>
<li>The election shall last 24 hours and use approval voting, allowing each voter to vote for multiple candidates.</li>
<li>The 50 candidates who receive the most votes shall become Members and form the TG.</li>
<li>The Member with the most votes shall serve as the first leader and lead the TG in the first two weeks.</li>
<li>Every two weeks, leadership shall rotate to the next most‑voted Member.</li>
    <ul><li>In case of a tie, the Member who declared candidacy earliest shall become leader first.</li></ul>
<li>No person may serve as leader more than once or for over two weeks.</li>
<li>The leader is responsible to coordinate among Members, organize Member meetings and report progress to the public.</li>
</ol>

## II. The decisions of TG shall comply with the following:

<ol type="1"> 
<li>All Members' votes and decisions shall be recorded publicly on a blockchain.</li>
<li>All financial transactions involving TG shall be recorded publicly on a blockchain.</li>
<li>TG shall not amend or override any part of this Interim Constitution.</li>
<li>Any Member may submit a proposal (hereafter "Proposal") that may include policies, decisions and financial actions.</li>
<li>A Proposal shall be ratified upon receiving approvals from 30 Members (a supermajority).</li>
<li>Proposals may be withdrawn by their proposer prior to ratification. Withdrawn Proposals may no longer be considered.</li>
<li>A Proposal shall remain under consideration until ratified by the supermajority or withdrawn by the proposing Member.</li>
<li>Each Member may have only one Proposal under consideration at a time, and may not submit a new Proposal until the prior Proposal is ratified or withdrawn.</li>
</ol>

## III. TG shall:

<ol type="1"> 
<li>Maintain stability, law, and order throughout the transition period;</li>
<li>Exercise control over the armed forces, law enforcement, and judiciary during the transition period;</li>
<li>Prepare multiple constitution drafts within 10 weeks of formation, enabling each Member to submit one constitution draft;</li>
<li>Hold a national referendum to ratify a new constitution after the 10-week period;</li>
<li>Enable every citizen born in 2006 or earlier to vote for any of the submitted constitution drafts in the referendum;</li>
<li>Recruit enough registrars to register every eligible citizen (who wants to vote) by two independent registrars;</li>
<li>Hold the referendum using approval voting, allowing each citizen to vote for multiple constitution drafts;</li>
<li>Hold national elections to establish a new government in accordance with the ratified constitution within four weeks of the referendum; and</li>
<li>Dissolve itself and transfer all power to the newly elected government within two weeks after the national elections.</li>
</ol>

## IV. If TG fails to fulfill its duties within 18 weeks:

<ol type="1"> 
<li>Three new Neutral registrars shall be appointed to restart the process.</li>
<li>The new Neutral registrars shall randomly select 1,200 new citizens to vote for candidates.</li>
<li>The 1,200 new randomly selected citizens elect 50 new Members in an open, inclusive and free election.</li>
<li>The existing TG shall be dissolved and replaced by the newly formed TG composed of 50 new Members.</li>
<li>If the constitutional referendum has not yet been held, the new TG shall proceed to hold the referendum following section 3.</li>
<li>If a constitutional referendum has already been held, the new TG shall hold a new referendum following section 3. The results of this new referendum shall override any previous referendum results.</li>
</ol>

## V. Members of TG shall NOT:

<ol type="1"> 
<li>Run for office or participate in any election for the new government;</li>
<li>Hold any official or unofficial government position for three years; nor</li>
<li>Run in any election or hold public office for three years.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="1"> 
<li>Ensure that 1,200 voters are selected randomly from the citizenry;</li>
<li>Monitor Members' compliance with this Interim Constitution; and</li>
<li>Oversee the elections and the referendum to ensure integrity.</li>
</ol>
